Rest in peaces.
Galo:

Lio:
It's a fate of burnish.
Galo:
What?
Lio:
Flames burn our body.
But they also give us the power to regenerate it.
While we're alive, our body is eternal.
Well, how much burn we recover.
But then, once our life comes to the end. Our bodies turn into ashes.
Galo:
For real?
Lio:
Is then no much surprise. All human die eventually.
We feed the flames, into the end, burn out.
That certainty reason is blessing.

Burn stronger!
More blaze hotter!
Flame is alive.

We always provide an escape route.
We take great pride in it.

As long as been hunted.
Galo:
Why can't you stop start fires?
If you gonna whole back, you'd be able living normal life?
Then never have to keep running.
