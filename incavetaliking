Galo:

Lio:
It's a fate of burnish.
Galo:
What?
Lio:
Flames burn our body.
But they also give us the power to regenerate it.
While we're alive, our body is eternal.
Well, how much burn we recover.
But then, once our life comes to the end. Our bodies turn into ashes.
Galo:
For real?
Lio:
Is then no much surprise. All human die eventually.
We feed the flames, into the end, burn out.
That certainty reason is blessing.
Galo:
You're saying lives all of the flames.
Lio:

We hear their cries
Let me hard burner!
Burn stronger!
More blaze hotter!
